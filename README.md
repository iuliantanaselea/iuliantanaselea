# About me
As a dedicated architect and computational designer, my journey into Python Development and Quality Assurance Automation Testing signifies a shift towards the dynamic intersection of design and technology.

Armed with a robust educational background in architecture, including international experiences with Erasmus scholarships in Greece and France, I am currently deepening my expertise in 3D Modeling with Python with an online class provided by the University of Michigan.

Recently completing a QA Automation Testing course at IT Factory, I am excited to leverage my analytical mindset and attention to detail to elevate software quality and reliability.
