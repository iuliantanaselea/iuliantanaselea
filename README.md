### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Iulian, a Romanian architect and computational designer, embarked on an adventure to learn Python. 

I'm working on growing my knowledge on Python Development and Quality Assurance Automation testing using Selenium, as well as API Testing.

Fell free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iuliantanaselea/) if you want to know more about my work and discuss. âœ¨

Thank you.
